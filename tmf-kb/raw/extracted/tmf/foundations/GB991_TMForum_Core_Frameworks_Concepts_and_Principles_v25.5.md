Executive Summary
This Core Framework Concepts and Principles document sets the guidelines and
best practices that help an enterprise design, plan, implement, and govern the
organization of its core building blocks. The structure of the document consists of
four main sections: Concepts, Principles, Frameworks (Models) and Methods.
Key concepts defined and described here provide the general ideas formalizing the
Open Digital Architecture (ODA). The principles established can help manage an
organization's enterprise architecture, with architectural assets such as the
Business Process Framework (eTOM), Information Framework (SID), Functional
Framework (FF) and Metrics etc. These assets are pivotal to managing and
operationalizing the enterprise. Methods breakdown of the complex running of an
enterprise into best practices, while the Models provide relational representation
of the core business blocks. Altogether, the Framework provides the supporting
"beams" to enable an organization to function according to an enterprise
architecture blueprint,
This document can be used as a business analysis tool with variations applied to
different businesses (e.g. Service Provider). It can also be helpful when clarifying
concepts to organize ideas. By leveraging a solid framework, as described in this
document, the reader is able to capture "realistically" core business concepts of
an organization and do this in a way that is tried and proven.

Introduction
The key concepts described in this document provide a common language and
understanding for the architect, other associates and business stakeholders. The
foundational CONTEXTS are used to establish the enterprise's building blocks.
These building blocks are fundamental to the Open Digital Framework (ODF) as
they define key concepts that are used throughout ODF. The core frameworks that
make up the TM Forum ODF include the Business Process Framework (aka eTOM),
the Information Framework (aka as SID), and the Functional Framework (derived
from the previous TAM).
The key principles provide the rules and guidelines that govern the application of
key concepts in the Open Digital Framework. The rules are designed to reflect the
values and goals of a digital organization, while providing direction and guidance
for decision-making. These principles help to ensure consistency, alignment, and
coherence across any architecture that aspires to align with the Open Digital
Architecture (ODA).
The section on method or methodology establish the processes and techniques
that help an enterprise architect leverage the Open Digital Framework. They
provide a structured and systematic approach to identify, analyze, design, and
communicate the architecture. These methods or methodologies are here to help
ensure quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the target architecture of the
organization.
Models are the representations and artifacts that help the enterprise architect,
design, document and communicate the architecture. In TM Forum, the Master
Open Digital Architecture (MODA) is the definitive reference for ODA which
provides the context and visualization of the structure, behavior, and relationships
of the ODA business objects (architectural elements). Models help to ensure
clarity, purpose, completeness and consistency of the architecture as they evolve
through a maturation process which improves its reliability for TM Forum
members.
The adoption of the TM Forum core frameworks has the benefit of providing
alignment with key industry standards and common ontology, in support of the
enterprise's strategic and business goals. This can help boost both business and
technical capabilities. All principles described in this document provide a
foundational ground for the development of the enterprise's governance, rules and
policies.

1. Concepts and Definitions
            1.1. Contexts
Contexts provide an overarching structure for the frameworks for the classification
and grouping of all business objects and architectural artifacts. There are two
types of contexts; 1) Horizontal Contexts commonly known as "Domains", and 2)
Vertical Contexts.
Not all domains and vertical contexts are present in each of the frameworks

           1.1.1. Horizontal Context (Domains)
Horizontal contexts are commonly known as Domains are of two kinds 1. Business
Domains (shown in color in the diagram below) and 2. Non-Business Domains.
The Business Domains represent areas of operations for delivery and
management of the business.
The Non-Business Domains represent collections of common objects and
technical functions supporting the business areas.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5


           1.1.1.1. Market Domain
The Market domain focuses on understanding, shaping, and influencing demand
by managing market intelligence, brand strategy, customer insight, and go-to-
market planning. It encompasses activities that position the organization in the
market, develop marketing strategies, conduct research and segmentation,
manage brand and reputation, and design outbound campaigns to drive
awareness and interest. The Market domain translates the organizations' goals
into market-facing strategies. The domain also includes the continuous
assessment of market performance, emerging trends, and customer behavior to
guide strategic decisions and shape the development of products and offerings.
            1.1.1.2. Sles Domain
The Sales domain focuses on the execution of sales strategies to generate revenue
by engaging with prospects and customers, managing opportunities, and closing
deals. It includes activities that convert marketing interest into actionable leads,
qualify and manage sales opportunities, negotiate commercial terms, and drive
deal closure across channels. The domain ensures that customer needs are
matched with suitable product offerings and supports ongoing sales development
and performance tracking. Sales acts as the interface between customer demand
and commercial delivery, operating through direct partner, and digital sales
channels.
           1.1.1.3. Product Domain
The Product domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried
out by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations and things) playing roles that are
involved in the strategic planning, definition, development and operational
aspects of Products that are conceived and offered for marketing and sales by the
Service Provider.
            1.1.1.4. Customer Domain
The Customer domain represents roles, activities, information and functions
carried out by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are
involved in the management of and all types of contact with customers as they
acquire, use, pay for and are supported for goods and services (i.e., products) that
they obtain from an enterprise. Activities include: Strategy to Readiness (e.g.,
customer strategies, capabilities, customer lifecycle management) and
Operations (e.g., customer relationship management , data, privacy, interactions,
communications, orders, accounts, balances, service level agreements (SLAs),
training, problems, cases, invoices, payments, disputes, collections, loyalty,
performance, usage statistics, analytics and support).
            1.1.1.5. Service Domain
The Service domain represents roles, activities, information and functions carried
out by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are involved in
the strategic planning, definition, development, and operational aspects of
Services that are used to realize Product offerings to the market. Activities include
management of: strategies, capabilities, lifecycles, catalogs, inventories,
installations, activations, problems, performance, guiding, mediation, usage
statistics and support of customer-facing services that are offered to customers
and resource-facing services that are presented to resources by an enterprise.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5


           1.1.1.6. Resource Domain
The Resource domain represents roles, activities, information and functions
carried out by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that are
involved in the strategic planning, definition, development and operational
aspects of Resources (e.g., functions, applications, computing, networking and
storage) that represent the infrastructure of an enterprise that are used to realize
Services. Activities include management of strategies, capabilities, lifecycles,
catalogs, inventories, topologies, installations, activations, alarms, problems,
performance, mediation, usage statistics and support of Resources that are
managed by an enterprise.
            1.1.1.7. Business Partner Domain
The Business Partner domain represents roles, activities, information and
functions carried out by parties (e.g., individuals / organizations) playing roles that
are involved in the strategic planning, definition, development, operational
aspects and all types of contact with Business Partners (e.g., Suppliers, Partners,
etc.) with which an enterprise collaborates in order to operate their business.
Activities include management of Business Partner: strategies, capabilities, value
propositions, relationships, profiles, data, privacy, security, interactions,
communications, tenders, agreements, orders, requisitions, supplies, accounts,
balances, inventories, reconciliations, service level agreements (SLAs), training,
problems, cases, invoices, payments, revenues, disputes, collections, loyalty,
performance, usage statistics, analytics and support of Business Partners as they
supply, acquire, use, support, purchase, pay for and are supported for goods and
services (products) that they provide and / or obtain from an enterprise.
           1.1.1.8. Enterprise Domain
The Enterprise domain represents roles, activities, information and functions that
are required to run and support a business. These concepts focus on both the
setting and achieving of strategic corporate goals and objectives, as well as
providing those support services that are required throughout an Enterprise. These
concepts are sometimes considered to be the corporate functions and/or
processes (e.g., Financial Management, Human Resources Management
processes, etc.). Since Enterprise Management is aimed at general support within
the Enterprise, they may interface as needed with almost every other process in
the Enterprise, be they operational, strategy, infrastructure or product processes.
           1.1.1.9. Shared Domain
The Shared domain is a specialized domain that is formalized for use in the
Information Framework (SID) and the Functional Framework. This special domain
represents information, functions and metrics that are not “owned by” any
particular domain and are referenced or utilized from two or more other domains.
          1.1.1.10. Patterns Domain
The Pattern domain is a specialized domain that is formalized for use in the
Information Framework. It contains abstract ABEs not directly usable. These
patterns need to be sub-classed to be used.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5


            1.1.1.11. Integration Domain
The integration domain represents business-agnostic roles, information and
activities (e.g., infrastructure, middleware, protocols) that support the integration
and implementation of ODF concepts (e.g., business entities, business
processes, functions, logical applications, interfaces, metrics, etc.).

           1.1.2. Vertical Context (Lifecycle Stage)
Vertical contexts are groupings of elements of the respective frameworks for
Development, Implementation and Operation of business entities and business
artifacts related to the respective horizontal contexts.
           1.1.2.1. Vertical Context Area (Lifecycle Area)
Vertical Context Area provide a classification of vertical contexts mostly relevant
to the Business Process Framework (eTOM) and the Functional Framework; they
represent a separation of concerns by dividing the enterprise lifecycle in two parts;
1) Strategy-to-Readiness (includes 'Strategy Management', 'Capability
Management', 'Business Value Development' and a shared part of 'Operations
Readiness & Support'), and 2) Operations (includes a shared part of 'Operations
Readiness & Support', 'Fulfillment', 'Assurance', and 'Billing').
           1.1.2.2. Vertical Context Stage (Lifecycle Stage)
Vertical Context Stage provide a classification of vertical contexts as a means to
further group them according to the two parts of the enterprise lifecycle, as
described previously.

Strategy-to-Readiness Lifecycle context area
Reference to section 1.1.2.1, the Strategy-to-Readiness Lifecycle context area
represent the grouping of the lifecycle Context Stages: Strategy Management,
Capability Management, Business Value Development, and part of Operations
Readiness & Support. (see Figure 1.1).
Strategy-to-Readiness" area identifies the business processes that can help
organizations prepare for engagement with their markets. It includes
transformation that readies people, processes and technology/platforms for
operations.


Strategy Management
The Strategy Management vertical is a lifecycle stage that focuses on business
objects that generate and manage specific business strategies, gain business buy-
in, track effectiveness of the strategies, and optimize strategy required.
Strategy Management is focused on the analysis and generation of strategies in
support of all development and operations within the enterprise while establishing
business commitment within the enterprise.
Capability Management
The Capability Management vertical is a lifecycle stage that focuses on the
development and deployment of capabilities including all infrastructures for the
delivery of products and services as well as support infrastructures and all
business enablers.
Framework artifacts in this vertical grouping identify requirements, design and
develop new or enhanced capabilities and monitor their performance to adjust as
required.
Business Value Development
The Business Value Development vertical grouping focuses on the definition,
planning, design and implementation of value propositions and business
promoting concepts/assets in the enterprise’s business portfolio.
Frameworks artifacts in this vertical grouping create products, services,
resources, business partner catalog information, sales and marketing campaigns
and material and process Operations feedback to adjusts as required for Lifecycle
management.
Operations Lifecycle context area
The Operations context area groups the lifecycle context stages: Fulfillment,
Assurance, Billing, and part of Operations Readiness & Support.
The Operations context area includes all the artifacts and building blocks that
support customer operations, as well those that enable direct interactions with
the customer. Such artifacts include both day-to-day and operations readiness
and support. The “FAB” (or "OFAB") verticals in Operations are sometimes referred
to as Customer Operations processes.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5


Operations Readiness & Support
Operations Readiness & Support lifecycle stage is responsible for ensuring
operational readiness and support of Fulfillment, Assurance and Billing.
Fulfillment
Fulfillment lifecycle stage is responsible for initiation, instantiation and fulfillment
of customer requests.
Frameworks artifacts in this vertical grouping initiate fulfillment actions and
convert requests (customer or business) into orders, to be delivered using the
value offerings from the enterprise’s portfolio. This includes creation of instances
of relevant artifacts in all domains necessary for the delivery of the value offerings.
Assurance
This vertical context is responsible for running operations along with monitoring,
measuring, analyzing and correcting to ensure the best performance, including
Quality of Service. Frameworks artifacts in this vertical context perform
continuous status and performance monitoring of ongoing operations. They
collect performance data and analyze them to identify potential problems and
apply preventive and corrective maintenance without impacting the customer.
The Assurance activities receive trouble reports and take necessary actions to
ensure timely corrections.
The Assurance activities ensure that overall performance and quality meets
service level agreements, metric goals (KPIs) as well as reporting.
Billing
This vertical context is responsible for translating business activities into revenue.
Framework artifacts in this vertical context perform collection of appropriate
usage records to determine charging and production of timely and accurate bills
and supports payment of services and operation-related cost accounting.
They provide pre-bill usage information and are processing customer payments
and performing payment collections.


            1.2. Business Capability Map
(FUTURE WORK)


            1.3. Business Process Framework
The Business Process Framework is a reference framework or model for the
definition, classification and decomposition of Service Provider business process
abstractions. A business process abstraction is a generalization of actual context-
specific business processes. So, rather than describing the process as it exists at
company A or company B, or in one part of an organization versus another, the
abstraction describes the essence of the process, and as such it can be used to

"categorize" any or all of those context-specific processes that match the
description.
For more than 20 years, the TM Forum has developed the Business Process
Framework in collaboration with its members, and has achieved industry-wide
recognition, from the highest conceptual concepts, to the detailed process
decomposition, taking into account real-world experience in the design,
implementation and management of business processes in a service provider's
environment and operations. It represents an ontology of business activities
without prejudice to specific business process models or workflows realized in the
context of specific enterprise strategies and market dynamics.

           1.3.1. Purpose
The purpose of the Business Process Framework is to provide a standard process
structure, terminology, and classification scheme for business processes in an
enterprise. It offers an enterprise-wide discipline for the development of business
processes that assure a consistent and reusable repository of processes in
business process models.
As a framework, it serves as a tool for discussion and agreement between
providers and consumers which encourage clear definitions, convergence and
understanding of:
    •   Business requirements
    •   Information agreements
    •   Application contracts; and
    •   shared data model specifications (exchanges between applications or
        systems)
TM Forum BPF is a cross-industry process view that presents a common ontology
for equipment suppliers, applications builders and integrators to define, build and
operate systems and solution.

           1.3.2. Scope
TM Forum Business Process Framework recognizes the different types of business
processes in an enterprise. The scope of the Business Process Framework covers
the three broad categorization of an enterprise business processes - Core,
Enabling and Supporting (also categorized in other ontologies as Operational,
Management and Supporting respectively.)
           1.3.2.1. Core Process
Core Process is a business process that constitute the core business and create
the primary value stream of an enterprise. They are strategically important to the
enterprise, and derive from the core competency of the business the enterprise is
involved in -like taking and delivering orders from customers, defining and
delivering products and services etc.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5


           1.3.2.2. Enabling Process
Enabling Process, also known as management processes, is a business process
that sets direction, like monitoring performance and executing plans for the
enterprise.
           1.3.2.3. Supporting Process
Support process is a business process that services the basic functions of the
organization, like accounting, technical support, human resource etc.

           1.3.3. Conceptual View
The conceptual view below shows the decomposition structure for a business
process, from the top level to lower levels. At the highest level of representation is
the "Business Process". The decomposition of the "Business Process" in directly
supporting "Business Activity" starts at the level 3.

           1.3.4. Other Concepts
           1.3.4.1. Business Process Model (Workflow)
A business process model is a graphical representation of a business process or
workflow and its related sub-processes. It defines the ways in which operations
are carried out to accomplish the intended objectives of an organization. Business
process modeling is the graphical representation of a company’s business
processes or workflows. This is usually done through different graphing methods,
such as the flowchart, data-flow diagram, etc.

methodologies used. See specific examples of Business Process Models in
GB921F and GB921E where examples showcasing specific uses of Business
Process Framework ontology to establish business process models that show E2E
workflows depicting for "product management" and "order management" etc.


            1.4. Information Framework
The Information Framework is an abstract but formal / defined representation of
business entities including their properties and relationships that can be
performed on them. A business entity is a thing of interest to the business, while
its attributes are facts describe the entity. The formal definitions provide a
business-oriented perspective to the information and data with a relationship
between information and data representing interests between two business
entities, or between a business entity and itself.
The TM Forum Information Framework provides an industry reference for
representation of concepts and the relationships, constraints, rules, and
operations to specify information semantics for a chosen domain of discourse. It
typically specifies relations between kinds of things but may also include relations
with individual things.

           1.4.1. Purpose
TM Forum Information Framework provides sharable, stable, and organized
structure of information requirements or knowledge for domain contexts. As a
framework, it serves the purpose of providing an enterprise with information
definitions along with underlying relations between information exchanged by
business processes.
In combination with the Business Process Framework, the Information Framework
offers a way to explain ‘how’ things are intended to fit together to meet a given
business need.

           1.4.2. Scope
The scope of the TM Forum Information Framework is to:
    •   Establish an enterprises approach to Information management and
        governance. This includes the aggregating closely related business entities
        and governing the relationships between business entities.
    •   Describe the holistic approach to managing information
        created/read/updated/deleted by business processes through roles and
        metrics to transform information into business asset
    •   Standardize the grouping of business entities into Aggregate Business
        Entities
    •   Formalize Relationship between Business Entities

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5


    •   Identify and associate a common set of key facts that can be related
        to business entities
          1.4.2.1. Aggregate Business Entity
An Aggregate Business Entity (ABE) is a well-defined set of information and
operations that characterize a highly cohesive, loosely coupled set of business
entities.
In information modeling, an ABE is a way to further partition DOMAIN by grouping
related Business Entities (BEs) together. ABE can contain other ABE or BE and can
be considered as sub-domains. A given domain can contain anything from a few to
over 15 ABEs.
           1.4.2.2. Business Entity
A Business Entity represents something of interest to the business that may be
tangible things (such as a customer), active things (such as a Customer Order), or
conceptual things (such as a Customer Account). Business entities are
characterized by attributes and participate in relationships with other business
entities. Business entity instances typically move through a well-defined life
cycle.
           1.4.2.3. Attribute
An attribute is a fact that describes a business entity.
            1.4.2.4. Relationship
A relationship is an association of business interest between two business
entities, or between a business entity and itself.

           1.4.3. Conceptual view
At the highest level, the Information Framework is structured according to the ODA
horizontal contexts (aka domains). Within each domain there is a high degree of
cohesion. Within each domain there is a high degree of cohesion between the
identified business entities, and loose coupling between different domains. This
enables segmentation of the total business problem and allows resources to be
focused on a particular domain of interest. It is envisioned that the use of the
resultant business entity definitions within each domain, when used in
conjunction with the Business Process Framework, will provide a business view of
the shared information. Within each domain, further partitioning of the information
is achieved through the identification of Aggregate Business Entities (ABE’s).

            1.5. Functional Framework
The Functional Framework is a collection (an ontology) of functions as defined in
1.5.2.1 organized in a hierarchical fashion based on functional affinity. This
organization is based on domains, verticals, and aggregate functions (AFs).
As the Functional Framework is an ontology, a given function is unique within the
Functional Framework.

           1.5.1. Intended Uses
Use by members (service providers, software providers, etc) can include:
    •   Rationalization of systems
    •   Governance
    •   A common language for describing systems and system elements,
    •   Basis for service provider to discuss with a software provider about
        solutions scope and functional coverage
    •   Organize and rationalize systems elements, including applications,
        components, APIs, etc.
TMF Use:
    •   Bridge between business-level concepts (Processes, Business
        Capabilities) and systems-level concepts (API, Components)
    •   Identify and describe the functions that are implemented by each
        component
    •   Identify gaps and opportunities for coverage in definition of the Open APIs

           1.5.2. Scope
The scope of the functional framework includes anything that
the systems supporting the Telecom Industry may need to do. The Functional
Framework scope is intended to include functionality of Business Support
Systems (BSS), Operational Support Systems (OSS), Enterprise Systems, security
and network elements within the Telecommunications industry. This includes the
non-business technical aspects.
           1.5.2.1. Functions
A function is a defined set of action(s) that a system is able to do in support of
business or technical needs. A function is defined as cohesive around a focused
purpose. Functions are typically characterized by action-oriented features, and
often focus on elements of information. Functions are implementation-agnostic
(identifying what systems do as opposed to how).
          1.5.2.2. Aggregate Functions
An aggregate function is a cohesive grouping of functions. The description of each
aggregate function should make clear on what basis functions are grouped
together within that aggregate function, and should provide sufficient basis to

determine whether a given function would belong within or outside of that
Aggregate Function.
Aggregate Function Level 1
Aggregate Functions Level 1 contain Aggregate Functions Level 2 or functions.
Aggregate Function Level 2
Aggregate Functions Level 2 contain Functions.

2. Principles
             2.1. Shared
 S-01           One framework organizes all ODA Core objects
 Statement      A shared framework is a common language and structure that enables
                different parts of the Open Digital Architecture to organize concepts that
                work together effectively towards same goals, by improving
                communication and collaboration, and by reducing confusion and
                misunderstandings.
 Rationale          •   Improve communication and collaboration between different
                        parts of the enterprise.
                    •   Better decision-making with context based on bounded zones /
                        blocks.
                    •   Provide a common language and structure for different
                        foundations of ODA to work together effectively.
                    •   Ensure producers and consumers are working towards the same
                        goals with reduced confusion and misunderstandings.
 Implications       •   Provide a common language and structure for Open Digital
                        Architecture foundation assets that serve as primitives for
                        enterprises to plan, transform and operate.
                    •   Reduce confusion and misunderstandings between different
                        departments or teams and help to ensure that business objects
                        grouped are altogether supporting same goals.
                    •   Improve communication and collaboration between different
                        parts of an enterprise, which can lead to better decision-making
                        and more effective problem-solving.


 S-02           Release and Publication Status
 Statement      The shared release and publication status for all ODA Core assets shall
                be one of:
                    •   Released
                    •   Preliminary
                    •   Draft
                    •   Not Fully Developed
 Rationale          •   Applying the same lifecycle statuses across all elements
                        promotes consistency, predictability, and transparency. It
                        allows for better tracking, management, and understanding of
                        the state of each element at any given time.
 Implications       •   Ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the
                        status of each element.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5



 S-02            Release and Publication Status
                    • Facilitates better planning and resource allocation based on the
                       lifecycle status.
                    •   Promotes accountability as each status requires specific actions
                        and responsibilities.
                    •   Enhances efficiency by standardizing the process of updates and
                        releases.


 S-03            Business-first understanding
 Statement       All business processes, information models, and software functions
                 shall be designed with simplicity and a business-first approach. They
                 should be easily understandable and directly contribute to the
                 achievement of business goals.
 Rationale       Simplicity leads to better understanding, efficient execution, and easier
                 maintenance. A business-first approach ensures that all processes,
                 models, and functions are
                 aligned with the enterprises objectives and contribute to its success.
 Implications Keep models simple and understandable by Business first, and then
              technology personas. This will:
                    •   Facilitate clear communication across all levels of the
                        enterprise.
                    •   Enhance efficiency by reducing complexity in processes,
                        models, and functions.
                    •   Ensure alignment of all operations with the enterprises’ business
                        goals.
                    •   Promotes a culture of simplicity and clarity in the enterprise.

(FUTURE WORK)

             2.2.2. Business Process Framework
 BPF-01          Nature of the Business Process Framework
 Statement       The Business Process Framework consists of a decomposition structure
                 and taxonomy of process abstractions representing business process
                 elements (i.e. groups of processes, activities and tasks) that a Service
                 Provider needs to manage.
 Rationale       The Business Process Framework is intended to be comprehensive - all
                 of a service provider's processes, activities and tasks should fit within
                 the Business Process Framework.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5



 BPF-01         Nature of the Business Process Framework
 Implications The process abstractions of the business process framework are
              categorizations of the context-specific processes that exist within
              service providers.
                The Business Process Framework provides a comprehensive catalog of
                such process abstractions relevant for a Service Provider. It provides an
                industry agreed standard consisting of process decomposition
                structure, terminology, and classification scheme of process elements
                across multiple levels of decomposition.
                The process elements of the Business Process Framework can be used
                to create consistent process flows (however, they are not business
                process flows themselves)
                The business drivers for adopting and using the framework can be
                summarized according to the following:
                    •   The need to standardize the language for describing business
                        processes
                    •   The need to standardize tasks on which business process flows
                        will be based
                    •   The need to understand the elements that make up each
                        business process.
                    •   The need to understand the objectives associated with each
                        business processes




 BPF-02         Standards for Organizing Business Processes - Naming,
                Decomposition and Traceability
 Statement      A business process element shall be named and decomposed according
                to the following pattern or structure.
                Naming:
                    •   Noun verb (for a business process grouping)
                    •   Verb noun (for underlying activities and tasks that support the
                        business process)
                Decomposition:
                    •   The Business Process Framework is decomposed from notional
                        Level 0 to more granular levels
                    •   The Levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 (and some of levels 5 and 6) are
                        addressed so far.
 Rationale      This prevents any confusion and establishes a unified level setting for
                business processes.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5



 BPF-02         Standards for Organizing Business Processes - Naming,
                Decomposition and Traceability
                Because the Business Process Framework is a decomposition model,
                the lower levels of the decomposition can be traced back to the higher
                levels.
                As a classification or taxonomy of Process Elements, at Level 0 the
                elements are classified into S2R (Strategy to Operations) and
                Operations. Lower Levels are formed by decomposition with each
                Process Element occurring once only.
 Implications       •   Achieve consistency in naming and decomposition following a
                        consistent pattern
                    •   Ensure the goal is implied in the name of the business process
                        with relevance primary stakeholders.
                    •   Ensure the name resonates with industry use or advances
                        industry consensus about the primary role the business process
                        plays.


 BPF-03         Classification of Business Processes
 Statement      All business processes shall be classified as one of the following types:
                    •   Core Process
                    •   Enabling Process
                    •   Supporting Process
 Rationale      Enable organizations to identify important business actions that impact
                their core business, enabling the management of resources and the
                efficiency of support.
                This includes cost reduction and resource allocation.
 Implications       •   Enable enterprises to understand and manage business
                        processes more effectively.
                    •   Identify levels of importance of business processes and allocate
                        associated resources accordingly.
                    •   Help to improve efficiency and reduce costs of operationalizing
                        business processes, while also ensuring that the enterprise is
                        focused on its core business goals.


 BPF-04         Definition of Business Processes
 Statement      All business processes should be clearly defined in terms of their
                structure, constituents, roles and purpose.
 Rationale      Enable organizations to ensure their business processes are consistent
                and complete.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5



 BPF-04         Definition of Business Processes
 Implications       •   A business process has characteristics that include goals,
                        inputs, outputs and business outcome.
                    •   A well identified, scoped and articulated business process must
                        provide clarity on the resources underpinning its activities.
                    •   Organizations should be able to realize goals linked to business
                        processes by formalizing them in specific sequence to realize
                        value.


 BPF-05         Information Ownership By Business Processes
 Statement      Each Business Process element should be associated with one (or more)
                Information
                Framework ABE(s).
 Rationale      To be consistent, processes must be related to specific information
                elements.
 Implications       •   Business processes do not exist in isolation. Processes require
                        information from other processes, and they in turn provide
                        information to other processes.
                    •   Dependencies (or associations) between processes occur when
                        an activity requires information from another activity. Process
                        dependencies are related to the entities and attributes required
                        by the business area.


 BPF-06         Business Process Ownership
 Statement      A business process shall always have a “Process Owner” who acts as
                the person or instance that has the highest level of responsibility and
                decision-making with respect to the process; such person or instance is
                designated as being accountable for the outcome that results from the
                execution of the process.
 Rationale      Responsibility can be shared amongst individuals involved in the
                execution of a particular process, however, accountability–which
                designates ultimate responsibility and ownership of the process–refers
                to the unique instance or person who is in charge of the entire process,
                and therefore accountable for the outcome resulting from the execution
                of such process, this instance or person is designated as the
                “accountable” party and it is in general referred to as “the Owner” of the
                process.
 Implications       •   "Shared responsibility is no accountability”;
                    •   a business process is always overseen and “groomed” by its
                        owner who is the person
                        or instance ultimately responsible for the outcome of the
                        execution of the process;
                    •   failure to designate or have implicitly a process owner or
                        accountable party would result in lack of commitment or

 BPF-06         Business Process Ownership
                        accountability in the event that the process is not delivering the
                        expected outcome; likewise, if the process is delivering excellent
                        results, it is most often the process owner (or accountable
                        instance) that gets glorified.


 BPF-07         Continuously Optimize Business Processes
 Statement      New information systems will be implemented after business processes
                have been analyzed, simplified or otherwise redesigned as appropriate.
 Rationale          •   There is no real “value” in applying technology to old, inefficient
                        business processes.
                    •   Core processes will be more streamlined, efficient and cost-
                        effective.
                    •   Core processes, activities, tasks and associated business rules
                        will be well understood and documented.
                    •   Reduces the total cost of ownership.
 Implications       •   Need to have an agreed upon continuous business process
                        improvement activity.
                    •   New technology will be applied in conjunction with business
                        process review.
                    •   Business processes must be optimized to align with business
                        drivers.
                    •   Additional time and resources will have to be invested in analysis
                        early in the systems' lifecycle.
                    •   Organizational change will be required to implement
                        reengineered work processes.
                    •   May require regulatory or legislative change.


 BPF-08         A core process has a unique position in the process framework
 Statement      All Level-2 (L2) business processes have a specific, unique position in
                the process framework, their position depends on the purpose, nature,
                and role of the process within the enterprise. As a general rule, each
                position is determined by the intersection between the vertical grouping
                and the horizontal domain to which the process belongs in the process
                framework. In general, L2 process belong to one unique vertical and one
                unique horizontal domain; however, there are some exceptions in which
                some L2 processes can span more than one vertical, these are
                commonly referred to as cross-functional or transversal core processes.
 Rationale      The Business Process Framework was created and evolved from two
                different but complementary models: 1) An Enterprise Architecture
                layering model (based on a construct of hierarchical architecture layers)
                which originated with the early concepts underpinning the TMN model;
                and 2) An enterprise lifecycle structure consisting of vertical groupings

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5



 BPF-08         A core process has a unique position in the process framework
                (aka lifecycle stages) which originated in the early concepts associated
                with the FCAPS model. Such design resulted in a matrix of X and Y
                positions, each position characterized by a specific couple
                ‘vertical/horizontal’, representing a unique stage in the enterprise
                lifecycle and a unique horizontal architecture domain; as a general rule,
                each position hosts several L2 processes, therefore, each L2 process
                belongs to one unique vertical and one unique horizontal domain;
                however, some L2 processes span more than one vertical, these are
                referred to as cross-functional or transversal processes, they are
                considered exceptions to the previous rule, and therefore they are prone
                to change in the future as the framework continues to evolve.
 Implications Level-2 (L2) processes play a vital role in the lifecycle of the enterprise,
              each L2 process represents a grouping of activities and tasks that deliver
              the intended business outcomes for each part of the enterprise process
              framework, as such, L2 processes are designed based on the role they
              perform and outcome they deliver, both of which are determined by the
              position of the process in the framework i.e. vertical grouping(s) and
              horizontal domain to which the process belongs. In the past, common
              process models were designed contextless–that is–core processes were
              monolithic elements decomposed into smaller granularity elements, but
              without being directly related or mapped to any specific context i.e.,
              didn’t belong to any particular enterprise lifecycle or architecture
              domain e.g., Product, Service, Resource, etc. The Business Process
              Framework (eTOM) brought along an innovative classification and
              modelling of the business processes across the enterprise, by adding
              horizontal domains and vertical Lifecycle stages which provided a
              meaningful architectural context.


 BPF-09         Business Processes lead on architecture requirements
 Statement      Business processes represent an implementation of the business
                requirements sourced from the organization’s strategy and business
                intent, as such, business processes embody the required support and
                full alignment with the business to ensure business operations and their
                goals are achieved.
 Rationale      Business processes embody the activities and tasks that need to be in
                place, to enable and support successfully the operation of the
                enterprise, business processes are in alignment with the goals of the
                business, as such, they translate business intent and required business
                capabilities into “implied” functional requirements that are further
                communicated to the functional, application and technology
                architectures–as subordinates of the Business Architecture–for
                implementation and execution through either manual or automated
                support, or a combination of both.
 Implications Business processes play a central role in the business architecture, as
              they define altogether the fabric of activities and tasks that are needed
              to effectively support and run the business. It is a vital principle to

 BPF-09          Business Processes lead on architecture requirements
                 always ensure an optimal alignment between the enterprise business
                 goals, and the capabilities available to support and achieve those goals.

             2.2.3. Information Framework (Kevin/Cecile- September 7)
 #INF-01         Coupling of ABEs to Business Processes
 Statement       An ABE shall be created by one business process (denoted primary
                 process). If a one-to-one coupling is not achievable, an ABE shall be
                 coupled to associated
 Rationale       A single primary process should manage the complete life cycle of an
                 ABE, creating, updating, and deleting entity instances contained within
                 the ABE.
 Implications If there is more than one process creating an ABE, this suggests these
              are overlapping processes, or the scope of the ABE is too broad.


 #INF-05         ABEs, Core Entities and Dependent Entities
 Statement       There should be one single core business entity in an ABE in general
                 (there are some exceptions however), in most cases the core entity has
                 the same name as its parent ABE.
 Rationale       A well-defined Aggregate Business Entity (ABE) consists of a set of
                 information that characterizes a highly cohesive, loosely coupled set of
                 business entities, which have loose relationships with items outside the
                 ABE.
 Implications A core business entity is an entity that is not dependent upon any other
              entity within the ABE. Likewise, generally, non-core business entities are
              dependent on the core business entity. And do not need to have an 'ID'
              attribute, given they can be reached by navigation from the core
              business entity.


 #INF-06         Principles for ABE Placement in Shared Domain versus Patterns
                 Domain
 Statement       ABEs and related BEs will be placed in Shared when:
                     1. One or more "Core" Business Entities are "Concrete", AND
                     2. Business Entities must be used in more than one domain without
                         modification or subclassing (e.g. - Party)
                 A core entity is a main entity (not a subclass)
                 ABEs and related BEs will be placed in the Patterns Domain when:
                     1. All "core" business entities are abstract.
                 Business entities, attributes, and/or relationships are inherited by
                 concrete business entities within other ABEs.

 #INF-07         Principles for ABE Placement in Patterns Domain
 Statement       ABEs and related BEs will be placed in the Patterns Domain when
                    1. All "core" business entities are abstract.
                    2. Business entities, attributes, and/or relationships are inherited
                       by concrete business entities within other ABEs.
 Rationale       To be completed
 Implications To be completed


 #INF-08      Inheritance
 Statement    The Information Model is built on the principle of "single
              inheritance". Not all business entities need to be "rooted", but a given
              class/business entity can only inherit from one entity.
              Notes:
                   Must verify that this is true
                   One reason for not doing multi-inheritance is because it can be a
                      challenge to 'implement'
 Rationale    To be completed
 Implications To be completed

 Statement       Within the SID model, an association is assumed to be bi-directional.
 Rationale       To be completed
 Implications    To be completed


 #INF-10         Ennumerations
 Statement       Generally, the Information model does not use
                 enumerations. Attributes with some number of given values is handled

             2.2.4. Functional Framework
Please note!
We are currently in the process of redefining the principles of the Functional
Framework. This is an iterative process and we plan
to remove the current principles and add new one as they are identified discussed
and approved to be included.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5


Previous List of Principles, will be curated in next version:


 #FUF-01        Nature of the Functional Framework
 Statement      The Functional Framework is a taxonomy of systems* capabilities that
                are relevant to the ecosystem of communications service providers.
                Systems capabilities are what systems are able to provide, defined
                independent of the context of specific processes, organizations,
                applications and implementations.
                *Software and/or hardware
 Rationale      It is the intent that all functions of the Service Provider can be supported
                by (i.e. are able to fit within) the Functional Framework functions. Each
                function has a detailed description that reflects its purpose.
 Implications The Functional Framework is a catalog of functions/functionalities that
              are relevant for a Service Provider.
                The Functional Framework specifies functions along with their
                descriptions and are grouped in alignment with the Business Process
                Framework process structure.
                The functions Process Elements are activity-based, and the Business
                Process Framework is thus an activity-based process decomposition
                model.


 #FUF-02        Definition of Functional Framework Functions [TO BE EDITED BY KAJ /
                DONE]
 Statement      A function is defined to produce one specified result.
                Functions are defined at such granularity level that the principle of
                separation of concerns is considered and when activated the function’s
                result will be accepted without exceptions.
                Each Functional Framework functions should be unique for each
                described functionality.
 Rationale    The functions of the Functional Framework shall be trusted to be unique.
              The function shall specify a functionality without exceptions.
 Implications A function specifies the action it will perform.
              A list of functions can be used to specify a collective functionality of e.g.
              a component or application, without the risk of conflicting functions or
              overlapping functionality.


 #FUF-03        Information Ownership Functions
 Statement      In Domains that are business context specific, (Market_Sales,
                Customer, Product, Service, Resource and Business Partner) the
                functions belonging to these domains have a direct responsibility type of
                relationship (Create, Update and Delete) with Information Framework
                elements.

GB991 TM Forum Core Frameworks Concepts and Principles 25.5



 #FUF-03        Information Ownership Functions
                Functions in the Shared Domain can be used in different contexts, which
                means that mapping to Information Framework elements will differ
                depending on where the functions are used.
 Rationale      A fundamental role of functions is to manage information. Based on the
                function's purpose it is related to specific information elements.
 Implications Functions are the primary way to manage information and acts on behalf
              of processes and other functions to manage the information of their
              ownership.
                Functions require information from other functions, and they in turn
                provide information to other functions, but each function should have
                unique impact on its related information.


 #FUF-04        Function Ownership
 Statement      A function shall always have a “Function Owner” that acts as the entity
                or instance that, from an implementation point of view, is responsible for
                the direct outcome that results from the execution of the function.
 Rationale      Responsibility can be shared amongst entities or instances of parties
                involved in the specification and execution of a particular function,
                however, accountability–which designates utmost responsibility and
                ownership of the parent process–refers to the unique instance or person
                who is ultimately liable for the outcome of the process, the process in
                turn delegates responsibility to the function in charge for the execution
                of the task(s) involved. Depending on the implementation scenario, the
                function can be owned by the delegating process itself, or by a different
                entity or party (e.g., outsourcing scenario).
 Implications "Shared responsibility is no accountability.”
                A function is always overseen and “groomed” by its owner who is the
                person or entity ultimately responsible for the outcome of the execution
                of the function. If a function owner or accountable party has not been
                formally specified or designated, the result could be a lack of
                commitment or accountability in the event that the function is not
                delivering the expected outcome; likewise, if the function is delivering
                the expected result, it is the function owner, or the accountable process
                owner, or both who get credit for the successful outcome.

 #FUF-05         Continuously Optimize Functions
 Statement       New functions will be designed and implemented continuously as
                 information systems and technology develop.
                 Functional Framework functions will continuously be analyzed,
                 simplified, or otherwise redesigned as appropriate to follow the
                 development.
 Rationale       For the management of the functionality of a corporate’s system
                 infrastructure the functions must be continuously improved, and the
                 number of functions expanded.
                 Functions will be used or referred to in many systems architectures.
                 To have access to up-to-date function specifications is of great value.
                 For systems architectures with high flexibility to improve individual
                 functions (e.g., ODA Components) the functional framework and the
                 functions are expected to be updated in a dialog with the industry.
                 For more stable systems the Functional Framework function and the
                 functions are expected to be a source of reference and inspiration.
 Implications There is a need to have an agreed governance of continuous function
              improvement activity.
                 New technologies will influence the Functional Framework and its
                 functions.
                 Functions must be optimized to align with business development,
                 architecture development and technology development.
                 Additional time and resources will have to be invested in analysis early
                 in the systems lifecycle.
                 Organizational change will be required to implement reengineered
                 systems with optimized functions.

3. The Frameworks
            3.1. Business Process Framework
The Business Process Framework (also known as eTOM) is an operating model
framework for Communication & Digital Service Providers (CSPs & DSPs) in the
communications and digital services industries. The model describes the required
business processes of service providers and defines key elements and how they
should interact.
The Business Process Framework is a standard maintained by the TM Forum, an
association for service providers and their ecosystem partners in the
communications and digital services industries. It is a hierarchical classification
scheme with descriptions of the key business processes required to run a service-
focused business. It is also a comprehensive, industry-agreed, multi-layered view
of the key business processes required to run an efficient and agile digital
enterprise. It provides a common language for use across departments, systems,
partners and suppliers, reducing cost and risk of system implementation,
integration and procurement.
The eTOM's business-oriented view of the enterprise is useful for planners,
managers, strategists and others who need to view the enterprise in business
terms, without immediate concern for the nature of the way that these business
needs are organized or automated within the business. Therefore, eTOM
emphasizes issues such as process structure, process components, process
interactivity and the business roles and responsibilities to which these relate.
The Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a reference framework for
categorizing all the business activities that a service provider will use in a
structured manner that allows these to be addressed at various levels of detail.
The processes are grouped by domains and vertical category context and are
decomposed starting from high level core, supporting and enabling processes that
depict key activities succeeded by lower level unique task activities.
eTOM serves as the blueprint for process direction and provides a reference point
for internal process reengineering needs, partnerships, alliances, and general
working agreements with other enterprises.

            3.2. Information Framework
The Information Framework (also known as the SID) provides an information/data
reference model and a common information/data vocabulary from a business
entity perspective. This 'business view' model uses the concepts of domains and
aggregate business entities to categorize business entities, reducing duplication
and overlap. Based on data affinity concepts, the categorization scheme is
necessarily layered, with each layer identifying in more detail the “things”
associated with the immediate parent layer.
The Information Framework's business-oriented view of the enterprise is useful for
software engineers, data modelers, enterprise architects as well as business
architects and strategists due to the fact that an information model identifies the
key data entities in business terms, serving as a bridge between the business and
technical areas of a business.

            3.3. Functional Framework
The Functional Framework is a collection of Functions described as automated (computerized) activities, provided for human/machine
usage through User Interfaces or machine usage through Integration Services.
The Functional Framework Function is defined to produce one specified result. The ambition is that Functional Framework Functions
are defined at such granularity level that when activated the resulting outcome will be completely accepted. For Functions with a
description listing more than one sub-function all sub-functions are expected to be performed at every activation.
The granularity level shall also allow only one Function in the Functional Framework for each described functionality. See the figure
below for the current high level map of the Functional Framework Functions.

4. Methodology
This section outlines methodologies for using the frameworks. While the
framework provides a singular and definitive structure with rules, concepts and
principles to plan or decide assets for the enterprise's information systems,
methodologies for modelling target systems and solutions vary and thus this
section will highlight relevant methodologies that the frameworks support.


            4.1. Business Process Modelling methodology
Business Process Modelling (BPM) is a technique to represent, analyze and
improve the activities and workflows of an organization. It helps to identify the
goals, inputs, outputs, roles, resources, rules and interactions of each process
(including activity and tasks).
By creating a visual and formal representation of the business processes,
modelling enables a better understanding of the current state and the potential for
improvement. Modelling also facilitates communication and collaboration
amongst the stakeholders, such as managers, employees, customers, suppliers
and partners (in an ecosystem management play).
Benefits BPM is that it can support the automation, adaptation and governance of
the business processes. Automation will use software and/or hardware to perform
tasks that would otherwise require human intervention. Automation can increase
efficiency, accuracy and consistency of the processes, as well as reduce costs
and errors. Adaptation refers to the ability to change or modify the business
process models in response to changing needs, demands or opportunities.
Adaptation can enhance flexibility, agility and innovation of the organization, as
well as enable it respond to/or lead markets. Governance refers to the
establishment and enforcement of standards, policies and rules that guide the
execution and evaluation of the processes. Governance can ensure quality,
compliance and accountability of the organization.
To achieve these benefits, business process modelling leverage standardized
catalog of processes, activities and tasks very well scoped, named,
defined/described and attributed to their goals. To realize these benefits in
practice, BPMs require the use of standards that define the syntax, semantics and
notation of the business process models. Standards are important because they
enable interoperability, compatibility and integration amongst different entities,
tools, systems and platforms that support the modelling, execution and
monitoring of business processes. Standards also require and ensure
consistency, clarity and completeness of the models, as well as facilitate their
validation, verification and testing. Some examples of standards for BPMs are
Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), Business Process Execution
Language (BPEL) and Unified Modeling Language (UML).

    •   Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN): This is the most
        widely used and accepted standard for BPM. It uses a set of graphical
        elements to depict events, activities, gateways, flows, pools and lanes in a
        process diagram. BPMN can capture complex and dynamic processes with
        multiple participants, roles and scenarios. BPMN also supports the
        execution of process models using Business Process Management
        Systems (BPMS).




   Figure 3-1 Example of BPMN

   (reference source: BPMN 2.0 Business Process Toolbox Pages | Enterprise
   Architect User Guide (sparxsystems.com))
    •   Unified Modeling Language (UML): This is a general-purpose modeling
        language that can be used for various domains, including software
        engineering, systems engineering and business analysis. UML offers 14
        types of diagrams to model different aspects of a system or process, such
        as use case diagrams, activity diagrams, sequence diagrams and state
        machine diagrams. UML is more suitable for modeling the detailed logic
        and behavior of a process, rather than the overall flow and structure. UML
        also requires more technical knowledge and skills to use effectively.
    •   Flowchart: This is a simple and intuitive way to model a process using
        basic shapes and arrows to show the steps and decisions in a workflow.
        Flowcharts are easy to create and understand, but they have limitations in
        expressing complex and parallel processes, as well as roles and
        responsibilities of different actors. Flowcharts are also not standardized,
        which means they can vary in style and meaning across different contexts
        and tools.

Other models are:
    •   Event-driven Process Chain (EPC): This is a BPM methodology that uses
        events, functions, connectors, roles and information objects to model a
        process. EPC focuses on the triggers and outcomes of each process step,
        rather than the activities themselves. EPC is often used in conjunction with
        SAP software to design and implement enterprise resource planning (ERP)
        systems.
    •   Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML): This is a BPM methodology that uses
        six core elements to model a process: stakeholders, value propositions,
        actions, measures, decisions and loops. LML emphasizes the value
        creation and delivery aspects of a process, as well as the feedback loops
        that enable continuous improvement. LML is designed to be simple, visual
        and collaborative.
    •   Subject-oriented Business Process Management (S-BPM): This is a BPM
        methodology that uses subjects, messages, states and transitions to model
        a process. S-BPM views each process participant as an autonomous
        subject that communicates with other subjects through messages. S-BPM
        allows for distributed and dynamic process execution, as well as adaptive
        and agile process design.
TM Forum's BPF provides the standards for identifying the composition of
business processes, a common library of tasks and activities performed with
objectives that dovetail the overarching goal of a business process, as well as an
attempt to organize them into a formalized framework of the Open Digital
Framework. Examples of using the TM Forum BPF can be found in GB921B.


            4.2. Information Modelling methodology
The information framework provides a 'data' view of the enterprise. The
SID identifies real-world objects of interest, models them as entities (or
classes). The framework then identifies important class characteristics, or
"attributes". Definitions are provided for both the class and the attributes. In
addition, relationships between these classes are identified and modeled as well.


            4.3. Functional Framework Modelling methodology

5. Meta Models
This meta-model is the structure of the MODA asset interrelationships as they
have been documented in the system-of-record. It has not been formally ratified,
hence we refer to it as "de facto".
